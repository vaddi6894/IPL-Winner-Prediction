# IPL Winner Prediction

This project aims to predict the winner of IPL (Indian Premier League) matches using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `jupyter_notebook file.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and prediction steps.
- `matches.csv`: The dataset containing IPL match data used for analysis and model building.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies** (if any are required, such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.).
3. **Open the Jupyter notebook** (`jupyter_notebook file.ipynb`) to explore the data and run the prediction models.

## Dataset

The `matches.csv` file contains historical IPL match data, including details such as teams, scores, venues, and outcomes.

## Usage

- Run the Jupyter notebook to see the data analysis and prediction workflow.
- Modify the notebook to experiment with different models or features.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (install via `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn`)

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements or new features.
